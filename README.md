Take a persons age in years and convert it into seconds
input: 18

1 year = 31557600

take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two.(This way a user can enter a birthdate and the application can compare the birthdate against the current time to come up with an accurate age.)

input: 08/12/1991
output: 842227200000

current date 04/20/2018(1524207600) - 08/12/1991(681980400)

Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet… (yikes!) To do this, the
application will have to calculate the user’s life expectancy. You can determine average life
expectancy as you see fit. A simple way to do this would be to have the user input the average
life expectancy for their demographic. A more involved way to do this would be to collect other
information from the user (e.g. lifestyle, country of residence, activity level, etc.) to
determine their life expectancy.
If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they
have lived past the life expectancy.
